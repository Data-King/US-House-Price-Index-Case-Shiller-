# US-House-Price-Index-Case-Shiller-


Case-Shiller Index of US residential house prices. Data comes from S&P Case-Shiller data and includes both the national index and the indices for 20 metropolitan regions. The indices are created using a repeat-sales methodology.




The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index is a composite of
single-family home price indices for the nine U.S. Census divisions and is
calculated monthly. It is included in the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index
Series which seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing
single-family housing stock.



Key points are (excerpted from methodology):
The indices use the "repeat sales method" of index calculation which uses data on properties that have sold at least twice, in order to capture the true appreciated value of each specific sales unit.
The quarterly S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index aggregates nine quarterly U.S. Census division repeat sales indices using a base period and estimates of the aggregate value of single family housing stock for those periods.
The S&P/Case - Shiller Home Price Indices originated in the 1980s by Case Shiller Weiss's research principles, Karl E. Case and Robert J. Shiller. At the time, Case and Shiller developed the repeat sales pricing technique. This methodology is recognized as the most reliable means to measure housing price movements and is used by other home price index publishers, including the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO)
